# Hate Speech Detection Intelligent Systems

This is a short "user's manual" to run the code used to obtain results.

The file containing the code is named "main_v2.Rmd", it is an R markdown file and can be opened with RStudio. 

In order to run and avoid errors, a directory named "Data" containing the csv files "train.csv" and "train2.csv" should be present in the same directory of the main.

To reproduce results you can run directly all the cells in RStudio.
